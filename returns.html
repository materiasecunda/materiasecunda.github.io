    <p>Fragrance is deeply personal, and we can't guarantee that our fragrances will meet or exceed your expectations.</p>
    <p>For this reason, we are unable to accept returns or exchanges.
        We kindly recommend trying our Discovery Set before committing to a full-size bottle.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your understanding and support.</p>
